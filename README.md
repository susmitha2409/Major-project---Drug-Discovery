# Major-project---Drug-Discovery
This project creates a model to predict strain-specific drug combinations using gene data, with the best of five tested models selected. Users can find drug combinations via a Streamlit interface, and results are visualized in a Power BI dashboard.
Drug Combination Prediction using Machine Learning with Gene Information Integration

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict optimal drug combinations by incorporating gene information. The primary aim is to identify strain-specific drug combinations, moving beyond species-specific predictions.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Models: Five different machine learning models were implemented to tackle the classification task. The best-performing model was selected based on performance metrics.
Fingerprint Selection: Three types of molecular fingerprints—ECFP, Morgan, and MCC key—were evaluated, with the most effective one chosen for the final classification.
User-Friendly Interface: A streamlined interface was developed using Streamlit, allowing users to input drug names and retrieve the most suitable drug combinations.
Data Visualization: A comprehensive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize and analyze the dataset, enhancing the interpretability of results.
This repository contains all the necessary code, datasets, and documentation to replicate the model and interface, along with the Power BI dashboard files.
